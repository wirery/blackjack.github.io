**Coin Catalogue Project**

In this project, I made use of **Node**, **Mongoose**, **Express**, and **EJS** in order to create an application to catalogue a coin collection.  I started by creating my MVS file structure and working mainly in node.  Once I had my main pages up, I went back and connected it to the mongo database using Mongoose.  After everything was connected and working functionally, I deployed it online using Heroku. 

If I had to go back and make this a better app, I would add better styling, and maybe a search feature, so that I could search for individual coins, as my collection grows.
